# nelua-terminal
a terminal emulator kind of written in nelua

basically i ripped code of a website, wrote very simple nelua code, and made a compiler script. i genuinely feel bad for doing this. no one should program like this.

i do intend on making it full nelua, but i honestly dont know what im doing
